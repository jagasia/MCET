CSS
	Cascading StyleSheet

is very popular stylesheet technique used in most of the websites.

Why we need CSS?
	Styling.	But HTML can do that.
	whatever related to presentation, can be done in HTML itself. Then why we need CSS?

	ans:	We want to separate the responsibility 
	one team will focus on the aesthetics	css developers
	one team will focus on the forms	html developers

suppose, there are around 10 web pages in a website.
all pages should appear consistently.

one css is applied to all the 10 webpages. Now, if you change that 1 css file, then all the 10 html pages are reflecting that change.

	ii) internal
