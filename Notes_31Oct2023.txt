CSS
	Cascading StyleSheet

is very popular stylesheet technique used in most of the websites.

Why we need CSS?
	Styling.	But HTML can do that.
	whatever related to presentation, can be done in HTML itself. Then why we need CSS?

	ans:	We want to separate the responsibility 
	one team will focus on the aesthetics	css developers
	one team will focus on the forms	html developers

suppose, there are around 10 web pages in a website.
all pages should appear consistently.

one css is applied to all the 10 webpages. Now, if you change that 1 css file, then all the 10 html pages are reflecting that change.
------------------------------
There are 3 ways you can use CSS in html
	i) inline
	ii) internal
	iii) external

inline:
	using "style" attribute
	ex:
		<p style="text-align:center">This is a paragraph</p>    
		<p style="text-align:right">This is another paragraph</p>    


internal:
	using "style" element

Selectors:
	element selector
	id selector
	class selector
	pseudo selector
	universal selector


        p
        {
            text-align: right;
            color:blue
        }

        #p4
        {
            color:red
        }

Task:
Identify the types of selectors used in CSS.


Reminder:

Note:
Delete "apache-maven-3.9.5-src" in your downloads folder. If you have copied it to softwares folder, then remove that also.

Download Apache tomcat from :
https://github.com/jagasia/tomcat

download the zip and unzip and then copy to the D:\Softwares folder

-------------------------
In eclipse 
	File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project


	http://localhost:8080/<<projectname>>/<<jspfilename.jsp>>
ex:
	http://localhost:8080/31-oct-1/index.jsp

Error:
Port 8080 required by tomcat v 9.0 server at localhost is already in use.

rootcase:
	Already our project is running. we are running again.		
	Already some other process runs in 8080. so we are getting this error.

solutions:
	1) we can find and end that process running in 8080
		to find which process is running in 8080
		in cmd:
			netstat -aon
	2) we can run our project in a different port number
		double click our server
			change 8080 into 8081	or 8082	or anything


JSP file is used as a VIEW
suppose, if user enters inputs in jsp and then submit the form,
it should go to SERVLET

We are going to create our first Servlet.
Servlet is a java program.
A class that extends HttpServlet is a Servlet.	
	HttpServlet is a sub class of GenericServlet

Servlets have life cycle:
	init
	service
		doGet
		doPost
	destroy

Life cycle is managed by container.
What is container?
	is a special JVM that provides runtime for Servlets  &  Jsp

Servlets & JSP are web components.

Right click project -> New -> Servlet

class name must start with Capital letter

Service method:
	the service method is called whenever the servlet is called

protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		response.getWriter().append("Hello world");
	}
http://localhost:8080/31-oct-1/index.jsp
http://localhost:8080/31-oct-1/MyServlet


Demo:
index.jsp
	should accept 2 numbers as input
	and submit the form to MathsServlet

MathsServlet
	should add those 2 numbers and print the output

How a servlet can get inputs???
	doGet	method has 2 arguments
